ZeroSeg 
==============

A code library for the ZeroSeg Raspberry Pi Zero add-on board from [[ThePiHut.com.](#)]

IMAGE

This board is designed and wired in the exact same way as the common 7-segment modules available, allowing the use of existing code and libraries to easily code your projects.

This code library was originally copied from Richard Hull's open source MAX7219 library [[right here on GitHub.](https://github.com/rm-hull/max7219)] 

This library makes it easy to scroll numbers and text along the Skeleseg's twin 7-segment displays, running via the MAX7219 IC, with just a few simple lines of code.

Raspberry Pi Setup & Installation
------------
MODIFY - DO IT CODE STYLE

I recommend using a fresh Raspbian image to avoid any conflicts.

 1. Download and install the latest copy of Raspbian from here: https://www.raspberrypi.org/downloads/raspbian/
 2. Boot (power on) your Raspberry Pi. The displays may light up, this is perfectly normal.
 3. In a terminal window, update Raspbian using ***sudo apt-get update*** and then ***sudo apt-get upgrade***.
 4. Next run ***sudo raspi-config*** and enable SPI. Select option 9 '***Advanced Options***' and then option 5 '***SPI***'. Select ***Yes*** to enable the SPI interface and hit enter.
 5. Exit the config tool by selecting '***Finish'***
 6. Reboot your Raspberry Pi by entering 'sudo reboot' and hit enter
 7. Once rebooted, run ***sudo apt-get install git build-essential python-dev***. Enter 'Y' when prompted, and hit enter. Let the install run (the displays may light up at this point if not already).
 8. Enter ***cd*** in the terminal and hit enter, to ensure you're in the home directory
 9. Next run ***git clone https://github.com/AverageManVsPi/ZeroSeg.git*** to download the ZeroSeg code library to your Pi.
 10. Enter ***cd ZeroSeg*** to enter your new ZeroSeg directory
 11. Next run ***sudo python setup.py install***
 12. Optional: To delete the files you won't need, and reduce clutter, whilst in the ZeroSeg directory run ***rm LICENSE.md***, ***rm README.md*** and ***rm setup.py***.
 13. With the files now downloaded, complete the SPI setup. First go into the library directory by using ***cd ZeroSeg***
 15. Next run ***sudo pip install spidev*** and setup is complete.
    
Run Example Code
------------
To make sure everything's working as it should, run the test script.

 1. Enter ***cd*** in the terminal to make sure we're starting from the same place (the home directory)
 2. Now enter ***cd ZeroSeg*** - this will take you to the main ZeroSeg directory
 3. Next enter ***cd examples*** to go to the example script directory
 4. To run the test script, run ***sudo python zeroseg_example.py***
 5. The displays should show the date, then the brightness should fade in and out. The date will then scroll left, followed by the time being displayed. Next the display will count up from a negative number, followed by hex numbers and finally random number count.

*NOTE:* By default, SPI is only accessible by root (hence using `sudo` above). Follow these instructions to create an spi group, and adding your user to that group, so you don't have to
run as root: http://quick2wire.com/non-root-access-to-spi-on-the-pi

Coding Basics
------------
Start your file by importing and initialising the `sevensegment` class:

```python
import max7219.led as led
device = led.sevensegment()
```
You can now start with something simple like displaying a number for 5 seconds on one of the displays. The deviceId is 0 for the right display and 1 for the left display:

```python
import max7219.led as led
import time
device = led.sevensegment()
device.write_number(deviceId=0, value=1234)
time.sleep(5)

```
